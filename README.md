# DrawScaledPlanetsInLine
Draws the planets in a line for the purpose of planning a tattoo

# Usage
`python planets.py`
You can modify the scale by changing `desired_length` value in the file

# Requires
* Python 2
* Matplotlib
* (optional) an interest in nerdy tattoos

# Example Image
![Image of circles in a line which represents the planets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OverlordAlex/projectname/DrawScaledPlanetsInLineblob/master/figure_1-1.png)

# TODO
* Scale by desired size of Earth instead of total length
* Allow the ability to draw moons
* Allow the original idea - earth on one side and the moon on the right with all planets fitting inside
